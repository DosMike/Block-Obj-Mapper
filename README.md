# Load 3D-Models in Forge!
### Take use of the advanced model loader in MinecraftForge 1.7.10
This ForgeMod will allow you to load 3D Models instead of Blocks.
For this I'm currently cloning the Block class using Javassist (not included), recompiling them and then using Forges substitution alias system to replace the blocks.
